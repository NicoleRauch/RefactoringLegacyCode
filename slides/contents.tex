\begin{frame}[fragile]{Workshop Outline}
\begin{itemize}
\item Presentation of the Problem Domain
\item Event Storming of the Problem Domain
\item Exploration of the existing codebase
\item Presentation of the existing solution
\item Presentation of the desired solution
\item Guided refactoring towards the desired solution
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Our Starting Point}
\begin{itemize}
\item Business Software
\item Very poor code quality
\item Planned changes for a module:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bugfixing
\item new features
\item better tests
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

$\Rightarrow$ A restructuring was required
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Domain}
\begin{itemize}
\item Financial mathematical software
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate for a bank account for each month:
\begin{itemize}
\item Balance at the last day of the month (ultimo)
\item Average balance of the month
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Domain}

\begin{itemize}
\item Form small groups (4-6 people)
\item Grab some modelling space and some post-its
\item Capture Domain Events 
\begin{itemize}
\item what happened in the past that was relevant to the business
\end{itemize}
\onslide+<2->
\item What data is needed to fully determine all aspects of each domain event?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Quick Poll}

\begin{itemize}
\onslide+<1>
\item Are there quick and obvious improvements?
\onslide+<2>
\item Is the code readable and understandable?
\onslide+<3>
\item Can you explain how it works?
\onslide+<4>
\item Can we write tests for individual parts of the code?
\end{itemize}

Make it worse to be able to improve!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Problems of the Existing Code Structure}
\begin{minipage}{.45\paperwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Code writes values into separate data objects (\glqq Push\grqq{})
\item Multiple writing operations for one value
\item Parts of  the code access previously written values
\item Code is driven by the view \textbf{from the inside}: What do I need to do in summary to be able to deliver a set of result values?
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} \hfill
\begin{minipage}{.45\paperwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Codestruktur.png}
\end{minipage}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Goal}

\begin{minipage}{.45\paperwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Structure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Code reflects the business logic
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item View \textbf{from the outside}, driven by the expected results:
\begin{itemize}
\item Which values do I need?
\item How is each value calculated?
\item Which categories of results exist? Similarities, differences?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} \hfill
\begin{minipage}{.45\paperwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{DynamischFein.jpg}
\end{minipage}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Overall Approach}
\begin{itemize}
\item Feature-toggle to compare the old and the new version
\begin{itemize}
\item Identification or creation of a minimal entry point to the restructured area
\item The API of this entry point must remain unchanged
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Important aspects of the restructuring:
\begin{itemize}
\item Driven by business logic
\item Purely structural (NO changes in behaviour)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Technical goal:
\begin{itemize}
\item Separation of Concerns
\item On-demand-calculation of all values (\glqq Pull\grqq{})
\item Bonus: Value caching via lazy initialization
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Important!}
\begin{itemize}
\item If in doubt, the existing code shows the correct behaviour!

\item Do not change the logic while restructuring!

\item Explicit approval of the restructuring
\begin{itemize}
\item It must show identical behaviour (tests, bugs, features)
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Workshop Restrictions \& Rules}

\begin{itemize}
\item Change one thing at a time.
\item Do not change the outside world (i.e.~\texttt{...\_API} classes), only the internals of our calculator class.
\item The code has tests. Run them frequently!
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Workshop Structure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Disentangle the for loops, isolate \& extract outer loop body
\item One data object per loop iteration
\begin{itemize}
\item no reuse
\end{itemize}
\item Data object $\rightarrow$ Entity
\begin{itemize}
\item calculate data on demand
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}
